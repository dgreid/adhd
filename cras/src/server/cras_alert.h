/* The alert facility provides a way to signal the clients when a system state
 * changes.
 *
 * First the clients registers callbacks to an alert. Each time the system state
 * changes, we mark the associated alert as "pending". At the end of the event
 * loop, we invoke the callbacks for the pending alerts.
 *
 * We do this delayed callback to collapses multiple callbacks into one (for
 * example, if there are multiple nodes added at the same time, we will only
 * fire the "nodes changed" signal once).
 *
 * There is an optional "prepare" function which can be provided when creating
 * an alert. It is called before we invoke the callbacks. This gives the owner
 * of each alert a chance to update the system to a consistent state before
 * signalling the clients.
 *
 * The alert functions should only be used from the main thread.
